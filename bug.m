In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management and object lifecycles, especially when using delegates or blocks.  Consider this scenario: 

```objectivec
@interface MyViewController : UIViewController <MyDelegate> {
  MyObject *myObject;
}

@property (nonatomic, strong) MyObject *myObject;

@end

@implementation MyViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
  [super viewDidLoad];
  myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
  myObject.delegate = self;
  [myObject doSomething];
}

- (void)myObjectDidFinish:(MyObject *)object {
  // ... handle completion ...
}

- (void)dealloc {
  myObject.delegate = nil; // Crucial step often missed
  // ... other deallocations
}

@end
```

If `MyObject` holds a strong reference to its delegate (`self`), and `MyViewController` holds a strong reference to `myObject`, a retain cycle is created. When `MyViewController` is deallocated, it will not be released because `myObject` still holds a strong reference to it, and vice versa. This leads to memory leaks and crashes.  Failure to set `myObject.delegate = nil;` in `dealloc` is a significant cause of this issue.
